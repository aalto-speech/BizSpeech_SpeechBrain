"""Script for training a BPE tokenizer on the top of CSV or JSON annotation files.

The tokenizer converts words into sub-word units that can be used to train a
language (LM) or an acoustic model (AM).
When doing a speech recognition experiment you have to make
sure that the acoustic and language models are trained with
the same tokenizer. Otherwise, a token mismatch is introduced
and beamsearch will produce bad results when combining AM and LM.
